# Introduction

In computer science classes it is hard to provide meaningful feedback to students on where their program went wrong and why it is wrong. Currently, a graduate student or professor needs to manually look through all programs submitted and identify if the program outputted correctly or not. If time permits they may try and identify where the program went wrong and what caused this problem. This is a very time-consuming process that effects introductory level courses where there are a large number of students. To help alleviate this problem, we created a tool set that provides some feedback on what the potential problem might be. This will then allow all students to receive some kind of meaningful feedback for their project while lowering the time required for grading.
